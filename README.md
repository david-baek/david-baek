## Hi there üëã

I'm David, second-year PhD student at MIT EECS doing research on Mechanistic Interpretability and Machine Learning!

I'm always happy to chat about any AI/ML-related projects, please feel free to reach out at dbaek@mit.edu :)

Below are my past projects:

### [GenEFT: Physics-Inspired Effective Theory of Representation Learning](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.111.035307)

We present GenEFT, an effective theory framework for shedding light on the statics and dynamics of neural network generalization, and illustrate it with graph learning examples!

### [Towards Understanding Distilled Reasoning Models: A Representational Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03730)

We investigate how model distillation impacts the development of reasoning features in large language models (LLMs) by training a crosscoder!

### [Harmonic Loss Trains Interpretable AI Models](https://x.com/dbaek__/status/1886781418115862544)

We introduce harmonic loss as alternative to the standard CE loss for training neural networks and LLMs. Harmonic loss achieves üõ†Ô∏èsignificantly better interpretability, ‚ö°faster convergence, and ‚è≥less grokking!

### [Hints of Universality in LLM Knowledge Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08255)

We study hints of representation universality across different LLMs via model stitching!
